<h2>GDS Direct+ App Documentation</h2>

<p>
You can inject the app on a page in your project to give user access to a GDS (Apollo, Sabre, Galileo or Amadeus).
</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;terminal-app-container&quot; style=&quot;height: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- http://gds-direct-plus.stage.dyninno.net/public/terminal-bundle.js on dev, but mind that dev url still works with live GDS, so be careful -&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gds-direct-plus.asaptickets.com/public/terminal-bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    window.InitGdsDirectPlusApp({
        htmlRootDom: document.getElementById('terminal-app-container'),
        // returned by https://auth.asaptickets.com/help/api#authorizeToken
        emcSessionId: '85f49ee15350fd6e8c6bc9c58a61a43e',
    }).then(nodeApp =&gt; {
        // nodeApp.preEnterCommand({cmd: 'V24Z84/WS QSBYC DPBVWS  AG 05578602 02JUL\n 1.1KLESUN/ARTUR\n 1 PS 188X 20DEC RIXKBP HK1   600A  735A *         FR   E', terminalId: 1});
        // nodeApp.runPnr({pnrCode: 'QWE123', gdsName: 'galileo'});
        // nodeApp.rebuild({data: {itineraryId: 1234, segmentStatus: 'GK'}});
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
It is basically a terminal where user enters commands and receives a GDS formatted response. What these commands usually do is searching flights in
airline databases to build the itinerary requested by customer, booking the reservation, issuing the tickets, charging credit cards, refunding, etc...
</p>
<p>
Since backend is hosted on node js, it is possible for server to preserve the http connection with GDS service endpoint resulting in 3 times faster response on a sequential command call compared to backend hosted on a php service.
</p>
<p>
When injecting this terminal in your project, you should keep in mind that some user actions may be destructive, for example if user books the reservation and forgets to cancel it later, or if he modifies a ticketed PNR.
There are mechanisms in this app that check agent roles and stuff, but they do not cover all possible formats in every GDS, so it's possible (even though not likely) for any agent to do something bad.
